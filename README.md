# SALLSCOM C++ Project

## Overview

SALLSCOM C++ Project is a console application designed to manage student data and calculate school and class ranks based on term test results. The application supports two streams - Bioscience and Mathematics, each with multiple classes. Students in the Bioscience stream study Biology, Physics, and Chemistry, while students in the Mathematics stream study Combined Maths, Physics, and Chemistry.

## Key Features

1. **Student Data Management:**
   - The application allows the user to input student data, including name, stream, class, and marks in each subject.
   - The data is stored in memory for further processing.

2. **Rank Calculation:**
   - The application calculates the total marks for each student and ranks them in descending order.
   - School ranks and class ranks are determined based on the total marks.

3. **Output to Console and File:**
   - The program prints the school and class ranks to the console for easy viewing.
   - The results are also written to a file named "rankings.txt" for future reference.

4. **Multi-Stream and Multi-Class Support:**
   - The application accommodates both Bioscience and Mathematics streams.
   - Within each stream, students are divided into different classes, and class ranks are calculated accordingly.

## Usage

1. **Input Student Data:**
   - Run the program and input student data, including name, stream, class, and subject marks when prompted.

2. **Calculate Ranks:**
   - Use the application to calculate school and class ranks based on the provided data.

3. **View Results:**
   - The program will display the school and class ranks on the console.
   - The results are also saved in the "rankings.txt" file.
